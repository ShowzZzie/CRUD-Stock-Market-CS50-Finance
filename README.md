# CRUD-STOCK-MARKET-Application-CS50-Finance
LINK: https://fake-stock-market.onrender.com

This website is a variation of Harvard's CS50x Week 9 Problem Set: Finance.

Apart from completing tasks required by Harvard, I added additional functions, such as:
- adding cash
- changing password
- buying and selling stock from the portfolio page

# What is this website for?

The project is a simple CRUD app which allows the users to simulate trading stocks of companies, e.g.: Netflix, Amazon, Tesla, etc. in real life. Application mimicks real-life prices by using the API KEY acquired from IEX (iexcloud.io).

# What technologies were used?

Technology used:
- Python (using frameworks such as werkzeug.security)
- Flask (including: flash(), redirect(), render_template())
- SQL (SQLite3)
- HTML
- CSS
- Jinja
